# Zenoh Variant — Custom Instructions

## Overview

Thin Rust binary implementing the `Variant` trait from `variant-base` using
Eclipse Zenoh as the transport layer. Represents the "high-level framework"
approach — minimal custom protocol code, relying on Zenoh for discovery,
routing, and delivery.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **Crate type**: binary (`variant-zenoh`)
- **Key dependencies**:
  - `variant-base` (path = `../../variant-base`) — Variant trait, types, CLI, driver
  - `zenoh` — the pub/sub transport (use latest stable, currently ~1.9)
  - `tokio` (`rt-multi-thread`, `sync`, `macros`, `time`) — the runtime
    owned by `ZenohVariant` for the publish/receive bridge (see Design
    Guidance below). Pulled in directly even though Zenoh already
    depends on it, so the variant has a stable `tokio::runtime::Runtime`
    handle and `tokio::sync::mpsc` API surface.
  - `anyhow` — error handling
- Follow `metak-shared/coding-standards.md`.

## Build and Test

```
cargo build                   # build variant-zenoh binary
cargo test                    # unit + integration tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt -- --check
```

## Integration Contracts

- Implements the `Variant` trait from `variant-base`
- CLI args per `metak-shared/api-contracts/variant-cli.md`
- JSONL logs per `metak-shared/api-contracts/jsonl-log-schema.md` (handled by variant-base driver)

## Architecture

```
variants/zenoh/
  src/
    main.rs       -- parse CLI, create ZenohVariant, call run_protocol
    zenoh.rs      -- ZenohVariant struct implementing Variant trait
  Cargo.toml
```

## Design Guidance

### ZenohVariant

- **Construction**: Parse Zenoh-specific CLI args from `extra` (the pass-through
  args from variant-base CLI). Expected args: `--zenoh-mode` (default: `peer`),
  `--zenoh-listen` (optional, e.g. `udp/0.0.0.0:7447`).
- **Lenient parser** (E9): the runner now injects `--peers name=host,...`
  into every variant's extra args (see `variant-cli.md`). Zenoh has its
  own discovery (Zenoh scouting) and does not need peer info. The Zenoh
  arg parser MUST silently ignore `--peers` and any other unknown
  `--<name> <value>` pair instead of erroring. Skip the value token after
  any unknown `--name` so the parser stays in sync. Update
  `ZenohArgs::parse` accordingly and update the test that asserts
  `--unknown` errors — it should now pass through.
- **connect**: Build a dedicated 2-worker multi-thread tokio runtime
  owned by `ZenohVariant`. Open the Zenoh session in peer mode and
  declare a subscriber on `bench/**` from inside the runtime. Spawn two
  long-running tokio tasks: a publisher task that drains a bounded
  `mpsc::channel<OutboundMessage>` and a subscriber task that awaits
  `subscriber.recv_async().await` and forwards decoded
  `ReceivedUpdate`s through a second bounded `mpsc::channel`. Zenoh
  scouting handles peer discovery automatically via multicast.
- **publish**: Encode the message on the main thread, derive the Zenoh
  key from the workload path (`/bench/N` -> `bench/N` — see
  `path_to_key`; do **not** re-add the `bench/` prefix), then `try_send`
  the encoded bytes onto the publish channel. Fall back to
  `blocking_send` only when the channel is full (deliberate
  back-pressure). The publisher task in the runtime maintains a
  `HashMap<String, Publisher<'static>>` cache keyed by Zenoh key
  expression and awaits `publisher.put(...).await` on the cached
  publisher.
- **poll_receive**: Non-blocking `try_recv` on the receive-side mpsc
  channel.
- **disconnect**: Send the oneshot shutdown signal to the subscriber
  task, drop the publish sender (which causes the publisher task to
  drain its publisher cache and close the session), drop the receive
  end, then `runtime.shutdown_timeout(2s)` to wind down anything
  remaining.

### EOT (T12.5)

- **Same session, same runtime.** EOT publishes and EOT subscribes
  ride the existing T10.2b bridge -- a second wildcard subscriber on
  `bench/__eot__/**` is declared on the same Zenoh session as the
  data subscriber inside `connect`'s `block_on`, and a dedicated
  `eot_subscriber_task` is spawned on the same tokio runtime
  alongside `publisher_task` and `subscriber_task`. Do NOT open a
  second session or runtime for EOT -- the deadlock fix from D7
  depends on a single session driven exclusively by one runtime.
- **Outbound EOT.** `signal_end_of_test` generates a `u64` random
  `eot_id`, sends an `OutboundMessage::Eot { key, payload, done }`
  variant on the existing publish channel (the publisher task does
  a one-shot `session.put().await` rather than caching a per-key
  `Publisher`, since EOT is one-shot per spawn), and `block_on`s
  the completion oneshot inside the runtime so the put is committed
  before `signal_end_of_test` returns.
- **Inbound EOT.** The EOT subscriber task forwards `(writer,
  eot_id)` pairs over a bounded mpsc channel into the variant; the
  task filters out self-EOTs (writer == self_runner) so the driver
  never sees its own marker. `poll_peer_eots` drains the channel
  with `try_recv` and applies a `HashSet<(writer, eot_id)>` dedup
  -- the variant is the source of truth per the EOT contract.
- **Shutdown.** A second `oneshot::Sender<()>` (`eot_shutdown_tx`)
  signals the EOT subscriber task to terminate during `disconnect`,
  alongside the existing `shutdown_tx` for the data subscriber. The
  EOT receive channel is dropped before `runtime.shutdown_timeout`
  so the task can exit cleanly.

### Zenoh API style

Zenoh's Rust API is async-first. The variant uses **option 2**: a
dedicated tokio runtime owned by `ZenohVariant` with mpsc-channel
bridges to the synchronous `Variant` trait. Originally the variant
used `zenoh::Wait` blocking wrappers for simplicity, but T10.2b
(see DECISIONS.md D7) found that the synchronous wrappers deadlock
under symmetric high-fanout (1000 distinct keys/tick on both peers
simultaneously) because `session.put().wait()` calls `route_data`
synchronously while the same lock and tokio runtime are needed by
the RX side. The bridge keeps the variant's main thread out of
Zenoh's routing path entirely, lets the runtime fully drive both
TX and RX in parallel, and combines that with a per-key
`Publisher` cache so the route resolution cost is paid once per
distinct key and not once per put.

### Message encoding

The variant needs to transmit: `writer` (runner name), `seq`, `path`, `qos`,
and `payload`. Options:
1. Encode all metadata in the Zenoh key expression + attachment
2. Serialize a small header + payload as the Zenoh value

Prefer option 2 — serialize a compact header struct (writer, seq, qos, path
length) followed by the payload bytes. Use `bincode` or manual byte packing.
Keep it simple.

### Testing

- Unit test: construct ZenohVariant, verify connect/disconnect lifecycle.
- Integration test: run the full protocol driver with ZenohVariant in
  single-process mode (the variant publishes and subscribes to itself, similar
  to VariantDummy but over real Zenoh). Short durations (1-2s operate).
- The binary should be runnable via the runner using a config like:
  ```toml
  [[variant]]
  name = "zenoh"
  binary = "./variant-zenoh"
    [variant.common]
    tick_rate_hz = 10
    operate_secs = 2
    ...
    [variant.specific]
    zenoh_mode = "peer"
  ```
