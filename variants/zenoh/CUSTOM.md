# Zenoh Variant — Custom Instructions

## Overview

Thin Rust binary implementing the `Variant` trait from `variant-base` using
Eclipse Zenoh as the transport layer. Represents the "high-level framework"
approach — minimal custom protocol code, relying on Zenoh for discovery,
routing, and delivery.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **Crate type**: binary (`variant-zenoh`)
- **Key dependencies**:
  - `variant-base` (path = `../../variant-base`) — Variant trait, types, CLI, driver
  - `zenoh` — the pub/sub transport (use latest stable, currently ~1.7)
  - `anyhow` — error handling
- Follow `metak-shared/coding-standards.md`.

## Build and Test

```
cargo build                   # build variant-zenoh binary
cargo test                    # unit + integration tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt -- --check
```

## Integration Contracts

- Implements the `Variant` trait from `variant-base`
- CLI args per `metak-shared/api-contracts/variant-cli.md`
- JSONL logs per `metak-shared/api-contracts/jsonl-log-schema.md` (handled by variant-base driver)

## Architecture

```
variants/zenoh/
  src/
    main.rs       -- parse CLI, create ZenohVariant, call run_protocol
    zenoh.rs      -- ZenohVariant struct implementing Variant trait
  Cargo.toml
```

## Design Guidance

### ZenohVariant

- **Construction**: Parse Zenoh-specific CLI args from `extra` (the pass-through
  args from variant-base CLI). Expected args: `--zenoh-mode` (default: `peer`),
  `--zenoh-listen` (optional, e.g. `udp/0.0.0.0:7447`).
- **Lenient parser** (E9): the runner now injects `--peers name=host,...`
  into every variant's extra args (see `variant-cli.md`). Zenoh has its
  own discovery (Zenoh scouting) and does not need peer info. The Zenoh
  arg parser MUST silently ignore `--peers` and any other unknown
  `--<name> <value>` pair instead of erroring. Skip the value token after
  any unknown `--name` so the parser stays in sync. Update
  `ZenohArgs::parse` accordingly and update the test that asserts
  `--unknown` errors — it should now pass through.
- **connect**: Open a Zenoh session in peer mode. Declare a subscriber on
  `bench/**` (or similar wildcard matching the key paths used by the workload).
  Zenoh scouting handles peer discovery automatically via multicast.
- **publish**: Put the payload on a Zenoh key expression matching the path
  (e.g. path `/bench/0` maps to Zenoh key `bench/0`). Include `seq` and `qos`
  as attachment metadata or encode in the payload.
- **poll_receive**: Try to receive from the Zenoh subscriber without blocking
  (`try_recv` or equivalent). Convert to `ReceivedUpdate`.
- **disconnect**: Close the Zenoh session.

### Zenoh API style

Zenoh's Rust API is async-first. Options:
1. Use `zenoh::Wait` trait for blocking operations (preferred for simplicity)
2. Spawn an internal tokio runtime and bridge via channels

Prefer option 1 (blocking wrappers) — simpler, and the protocol driver
already controls timing via its tick loop.

### Message encoding

The variant needs to transmit: `writer` (runner name), `seq`, `path`, `qos`,
and `payload`. Options:
1. Encode all metadata in the Zenoh key expression + attachment
2. Serialize a small header + payload as the Zenoh value

Prefer option 2 — serialize a compact header struct (writer, seq, qos, path
length) followed by the payload bytes. Use `bincode` or manual byte packing.
Keep it simple.

### Testing

- Unit test: construct ZenohVariant, verify connect/disconnect lifecycle.
- Integration test: run the full protocol driver with ZenohVariant in
  single-process mode (the variant publishes and subscribes to itself, similar
  to VariantDummy but over real Zenoh). Short durations (1-2s operate).
- The binary should be runnable via the runner using a config like:
  ```toml
  [[variant]]
  name = "zenoh"
  binary = "./variant-zenoh"
    [variant.common]
    tick_rate_hz = 10
    operate_secs = 2
    ...
    [variant.specific]
    zenoh_mode = "peer"
  ```
